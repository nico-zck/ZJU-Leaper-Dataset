		MCALabC110 INSTALL PROCEDURE UNDER UNIX/LINUX/MACOS X.
		 TODO: this toolbox has not been tested under Windows.

1. PREREQUISITE

  a. Install the version .802 of WaveLab software package if it has not 
   been installed; check 
	http://www-stat.Stanford.edu/~wavelab/
   for installation instructions.

  b. Optional:

    - The MCALabC110 toolbox uses the undecimated DWT code from DSP Rice 
    and the 2nd generation fast curvelet transform.
    These two transforms are included for convenience in this package in the UDWT and CURV subdirectory.
    Their mex files have been compiled for Unix Solaris/Linux/MACOS X.
    Please see www.dsp-rice.edu and curvelet.org for licence agreement.
    
    NOTE: the CurveLab wrapping functions (i)fdct_wrapping.m have been slightly modified from the original 
    to implement curvelets at the finest scale.


2. UNPACK THE ARCHIVE 

  a. Copy MCALabCWithUtilities.tgz to to the place you want the MCALab Directory to reside.

  b. Uncompress

     tar xfz MCALabCWithUtilities.tgz

  c. After you uncompress the file for your machine, you should have
   the following directory structure:
    	MCALabWithUtilities
    	MCALabWithUtilities/CurveletToolbox/
    	MCALabWithUtilities/MCALab110/
    	MCALabWithUtilities/UDWT/
    	MCALabWithUtilities/Utils/
    	   	

3. SET YOUR PATH
   a. Edit the file MCAPATH.m, modify the line to your path:
	MCALABPATH = ['<AbsolutePathNameforMCALabWithUtilitiesMainDirectory>'];

   b. Be sure that MCAPath executes each time you start Matlab by modifying your startup.m.
