function S = SetScaleToZero(n);
% SetScaleZero: Construct a matrix which is one on the support of a
%               Meyer window and zero outside. 
%  Usage:
%      S = SetScaleToZero(n);
%  Inputs:
%      n   dyadic integer, n = 2*2^j
%  Outputs:
%      S   n*n matrix
%  Description 
%      S is equal to 1 on the support of the Meyer window which
%      isolates frequencies near |k| = 2^(j-1)  
%      This is used to precondition the CG solver.
