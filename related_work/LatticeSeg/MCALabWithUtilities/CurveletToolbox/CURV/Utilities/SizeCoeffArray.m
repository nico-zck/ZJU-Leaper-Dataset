function nn = SizeCoeffArray(n,deep);
% Usage:
%   nn = SizeCoeffArray(n,deep);
% Inputs:
%   n      Dyadic integer
%   deep   2^deep is the number of angular sectors in each of the
%          directional  panels N,E,S,W.
% Outputs:
%  nn = vector of length 4.
% Description:
%   Calculate the size of the data structure correpsonding to the
%   curvelet coefficients at a given scale; n is the length of the 
%   array obtained after scale separation.
