% AdaptIntro -- Info about AdaptDemo%% The files in this directory can reproduce the figures in the paper%    ``Adapting to Unknown Smoothness via Wavelet Shrinkage''% by D.L. Donoho and I.M. Johnstone.%% This paper is available by www from %		http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/Reports/1993/ausws.ps.Z%% The paper proposes soft thresholding of wavelet coefficients% with an adaptively-chosen threshold. The threshold is chosen% using the SURE (Stein's unbiased estimate of risk) for the% Soft Thresholding Estimator.  The paper shows that this has% various optimality properties for mean-squared error estimation.%
