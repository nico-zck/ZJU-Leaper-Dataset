% scfig03 -- Short Course 03: Comparison of Wavelet and Packet DeNoising
%
% Here a synthetic signal, ``MishMash'', containing a quadratic
% and a linear chirp, along with a high-frequency sinusoid, is
% being studied (Panel a).  A noisy version is created, (Panel b) 
% and this noisy version is then de-noised using wavelet shrinkage.
% (Panel c) The results are poor, in that the fine structure of the 
% oscillating noiselss object is lost.
%
% In contrast, De-noising in an adaptively chosen cosine packet basis
% removes the noise and produces an acceptable approximation to the
% original noiseless object. (Panel d)
