%   These figures illustrate the application of thresholding in the
%   wavelet, wavelet packet, and cosine packet domains to recovery
%   of objects from noisy and incomplete data. References are given to
%   recent work of Donoho, Johnstone, Kerkyacharian, Picard, Gao and
%   researchers in other groups.
