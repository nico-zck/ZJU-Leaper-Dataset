% mefig401 -- Multi-Resolution Filter Bank output, object "Ramp"
%
% As described in the text, the coefficients of the segmented
% wavelet transform differ from the unsegmented transform only
% in a few coefficients near the segmentation point.  The multi-
% resolution filter bank described in the text calculates exactly
% those coefficients which differ.  Here we show its output
% for object "Ramp".  The output is localized to sites near
% the discontinuity.
