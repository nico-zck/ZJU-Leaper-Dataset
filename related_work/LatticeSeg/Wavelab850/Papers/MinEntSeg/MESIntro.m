%   These figures illustrate the use of a segmented wavelet transform
%   for compressing and de-noising data 
%
%   WARNING: Figures 4.1 and later all require use of the fast all
%   segmentations algorithm. The .m implementation of this algorithm
%   is orders of magnitude slower than the .mex implementation.  If
%   you don't have the .mex files installed that are appropriate to
%   your machine, you will probably take HOURS to complete this set
%   of scripts.
