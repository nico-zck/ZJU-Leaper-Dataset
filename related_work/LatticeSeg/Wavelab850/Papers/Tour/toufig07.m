% toufig07 -- Tour Figure 07: Comparing Compression Abilities
%
% Here we depict the compression numbers c_n in three different
% signal domains {Wavelet, Haar, Cosine} of four different signals
% {Bumps, Blocks, HeaviSine, and Doppler}. The numbers c_n are the
% mean-squared reconstruction errors of reconstructions which use
% at most n nonzero coefficients in the transfrom domain. 
%
% Blocks: The Haar Basis has the best compression numbers,
% for obvious reasons.  The Wavelet basis is not bad, and the Fourier basis
% is far worse than either the Wavelet or Haar basis.
%
% Bumps: The Wavelet Basis has the best compression numbers, with the Haar
% not bad, and the Fourier basis being far inferior.
%
% HeaviSine: The near-sinusoidal behavior make the Fourier basis a good choice
% but Wavelets really are not bad here. Surprisingly, if very high accuracy is
% required, the Haar basis beats Fourier, because the Fourier basis has trouble 
% modelling jumps.
%
% Doppler: Wavelets are much better than either Fourier or Haar.
