% toufig13 -- Tour Figure 13: Noisy Deconvolution
%
% In this example, the object ``Bumps'' is convolved with a recursive
% filter that blurs out the sharp structure; and then noise is added.
% (panels a,b)
%
% The deconvolution problem is ill-posed, in that when we apply the
% inverse filter, we get an object which is extremely noisy and has
% no real resemblance to the original object. (panel c)
%
% When we apply thresholding in the wavelet domain, with thresholds
% specially chosen to adapt to the structure of the deconvolution
% problem, we get a reconstruction which is nearly noise free and which
% also preserves the structure of the Bumps object. (panel d)
