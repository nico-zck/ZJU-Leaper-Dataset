% asfig02 -- Asymptopia Figure 02: Four Spatially Inhomogenoeus Signals
%
% Here we depict four signals chosen as caricatures of signals arising
% in scientific signal processing.
%
% Blocks is a piecewise constant signal, a caricature of a scan line
% through a 2-d image depicting an object with several edges.
%
% Bumps is a very peaky signal, a caricature of an NMR Spectrum.
% 
% HeaviSine is a sinusoid with two clicks.
%
% Doppler is an attenuating sinusoid with time-varying frequency.
%
% These objects are interesting to us because they portray significant
% spatial inhomogeneity.
