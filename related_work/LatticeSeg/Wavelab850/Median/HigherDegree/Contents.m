% Median:Contents  v.850 -- Median Interpolating Pyramid Transform Tools
% 
%   The routines in this directory implements an iterative algorithm
% for median-interpolation for D > 2. At the moment, the convergence
% property of this algorithm is still missing a step in the proof. 
% However, experiments (and the not yet completed theory) suggest 
% an exponential rate of convergence.
