WaveLab 802
------------

WaveLab is a library of Matlab routines for wavelet analysis, wavelet-
packet analysis, cosine-packet analysis and matching pursuit. The
library is available free of charge over the Internet.  Versions are
provied for Macintosh, UNIX and Windows machines.

WaveLab has been used in teaching courses in adapted wavelet analysis at
Stanford and at Berkeley.  It is the basis for wavelet research by the
authors, and may be used to reproduce the figures in their published
articles, and to redo those figures with variations in the parameters.

WaveLab has over 800 files which are documented, indexed and cross-
referenced in various ways.  Matlab .mex files are used extensively to
increase throughput, and "fat" mex files are provided with the Macintosh
version so Power Macintosh users may take advantage of the increased
speed of their machines.

In addition to routines implementing basic wavelet transforms for finite
data sets (both periodic transforms and boundary-corrected transforms),
wavelet-packet analysis, cosine-packet analysis and matching pursuit,
the library contains scripts which the authors believe will assist in
learning the practical aspects of wavelet analysis:

    * Scripts that reproduce the figures in the authors' published
      articles including the de-noising articles of Donoho and Johnstone.
       
    * ``Workouts'' that give a quick guide to wavelets (1-d and 2-d);
      wavelet analysis; wavelet synthesis; wavelet and cosine packets,
      including the Coifman-Wickerhauser best-basis methodology; matching
      pursuit; and applications such as data expansion, progressive data
      transmission image compression, speech segmentation, de-noising, fast
      matrix multiplication in wavelet bases, etc.

WaveLab also offers:

    * A library of datasets that are easily accessible to the user.  Besides
      artifical signals that have scientific or pedagogic appeal, real data
      ranging from an image of Ingrid Daubechies to a recording by Enrico
      Caruso are included.
      
    * A point-and-click browser that allows the user to select data, perform
      various transforms or de-noising operations, and then see the results
      without using the Matlab command-line interface.
      
    * Extensive documentation, including on-line documentation for each
      function, Contents files for each subdirectory, a Reference Manual,
      an Architecture Manual and an overview document (About WaveLab) that
      introduces the software to a first-time user.

WaveLab is freeware and may be obtained via World-Wide-Web:

Getting Started
---------------

The subdirectory Documentation contains several files which should
enable the user to get started in using this package.  The first things
to read are INSTALLATION.m and GETTINGSTARTED.m.
