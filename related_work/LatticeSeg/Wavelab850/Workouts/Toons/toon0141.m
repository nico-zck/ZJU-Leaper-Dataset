% toon0141 -- Illustrating Boundary Wavelets
%
%  On a finite interval, one has also to make a choice about the
%  boundary behavior.  The two choices:
%
%  1. Periodization. The wavelets that encounter the boundary, 
%     simply wrap around, as if the interval were a circle.
%
%  2. Boundary-Adjustment. The wavelets located near the boundary
%     are deformed versions of the wavelets at the interior.
%
%  Here we display wavelets at the interior of an interval, and
%  the two different behaviors the same wavelets can show at the boundary.

	phi40 = IWT_CDJV(w,4,3);
