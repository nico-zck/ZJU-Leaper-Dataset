% toon0551 -- Four Spatially Inhomogenoeus Signals
%
%  These four signals are caricatures of signals arising
%  in scientific signal processing.
%
%  Blocks is a piecewise constant signal, a caricature of a scan line
%  through a 2-d image depicting an object with several edges.
%
%  Bumps is a very peaky signal, a caricature of an NMR Spectrum.
% 
%  HeaviSine is a sinusoid with two clicks.
%
%  Doppler is an attenuating sinusoid with time-varying frequency.
%
%  These objects are interesting to us because they portray significant
%  spatial inhomogeneity.
