% MultiFractal:Contents -- Continuous Wavelet Transform Workouts
%
% This directory currently consists of two scripts that illustrate
% various aspects of the continuous wavelet transform on both a
% Cantor-type signal and fractional Brownian motion.
%
% We hope to add workouts to reproduce the figures in the book by
% Arneodo et al. ("Ondelettes, Multifractals, et Turbulences,"
% Diderot Edition, Paris) and the paper by Alexandrescu et al.
% ("Detection of Geomagentic Jerks using Wavelet Analysis," 
% Journal of Geophysical Research Vol. 10, pp. 12,557-12,572).
