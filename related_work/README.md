### Notable Things:

1. The implementations of `EloRating` and `IDMethod` are sourced from <https://ytngan.wordpress.com/codes>;
2. Due to many details are ignored in these original papers, some parts of these code implementations cannot be
   guaranteed to be completely correct. Thus, their performance may not consistent with that reported in these papers.
   If you find any thing wrong, please let us know;
3. All these methods are originally designed for the [HKU Fabric Dataset](https://ytngan.wordpress.com/codes/), that is,
   these methods may tend to achieve poor performance on other datasets, including ZJU-Leaper Dataset.
